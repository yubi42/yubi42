## Coding Philosophy

I believe that coding is a harmonious blend of creativity and logic. While front-end development offers visual creativity, I find my true passion in back-end development, where I can architect solutions and design systems. I appreciate how programming languages allow for precise instructions and predictable outcomes, while still valuing the nuance and creativity of human communication and collaboration.

## Goals & Interests

With an inventor's spirit and a "mad scientist" heart, I'm driven by the desire to create and innovate. I aim to leverage my coding skills to develop solutions that make the world a better place.
