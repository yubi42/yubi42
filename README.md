## Coding Philosophy
For me, coding combines two things that I really like: logical thinking and being creative! While front-end development often follows predefined designs and user expectations, I find true creativity in back-end developmentâ€”where I can invent my own solutions, design architectures, and implement ideas in unique ways. The ability to approach a problem from multiple angles and choose how to bring a system to life is what excites me the most about coding.

<br>

## Goals & Interests

With an inventor's spirit and a "mad scientist" heart, I'm driven by curiosity and the constant pursuit of knowledge. I love learning new technologies, expanding my understanding of different programming paradigms, and exploring innovative solutions to complex problems.
