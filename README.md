## Coding Philosophy

I believe that coding is a harmonious blend of creativity and logic. While front-end development offers visual creativity, I find my true passion in back-end development, where I can architect solutions and design systems. I appreciate how programming languages allow for precise instructions and predictable outcomes, while still valuing the nuance and creativity of human communication and collaboration.
