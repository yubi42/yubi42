# About Me

Hello! I'm **yubi42**, a passionate full-stack web developer and software engineer based in Berlin, Germany. My journey into the tech world began in September 2022, and I've been dedicated to honing my skills and contributing to meaningful projects ever since.

## Education & Experience
- **42 Berlin - Core Curriculum**  
  (May 2023 - Present)  
  At 42 Berlin, I've been immersed in a peer-to-peer learning environment, tackling complex coding projects that emphasize problem-solving and autonomy. I'm currently completing my final project, which has been a culmination of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program. Technologies and tools Iâ€™ve worked with include:
  - C, C++
  - Python, Django
  - PostgresSQL
  - Docker, Virtual Machines
  - Linux, Shell
  - System programming and low-level computing

- **Supercode - Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp**  
  (September 2022 - February 2023)  
  During this intensive 22-week program, I gained hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development. The curriculum covered:
  - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
  - Front-end frameworks and libraries
  - Back-end development with Node.js and Express.js
  - Database management with MongoDB
  - Version control with Git and GitHub

## Skills & Technologies

- **Languages**: C, C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, 
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: React.js, Node.js, Django
- **Databases**: MongoDB, PostgresSQL
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Docker, Virtual Machines, Linux, Shell

## Projects

- **Minishell**: Developed a simplified Unix shell in C, replicating bash behavior to reinforce knowledge of process management and system calls.
- **Pipex**: Created a program to simulate shell piping (`|`), enhancing understanding of inter-process communication.
- **Get Next Line**: Implemented a function in C to read lines from a file descriptor efficiently, managing dynamic memory and multiple descriptors.

## Coding Philosophy

I believe that coding is a harmonious blend of creativity and logic. While front-end development offers visual creativity, I find my true passion in back-end development, where I can architect solutions and design systems. 
I appreciate how programming languages allow for precise instructions and predictable outcomes, while still valuing the nuance and creativity of human communication and collaboration.

## Goals & Interests

With an inventor's spirit and a "mad scientist" heart, I'm driven by the desire to create and innovate. I aim to leverage my coding skills to develop solutions that make the world a better place.
